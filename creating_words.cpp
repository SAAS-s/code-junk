/*
Creating words
Matthew is given two strings a and b, both of length 3. 
He thinks its particularly funny to create two new words by
swapping the first character of a with the first character
of b. He wants you to output a and b after the swap.

Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.

Input
The first line contains t(1≤t≤100)  — the number 
of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, a
and b, both of length 3.
The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.

Output
For each test case, after the swap, output a
and b, separated by a space.

Example

input
6
bit set
cat dog
hot dog
uwu owo
cat cat
zzz zzz

output
sit bet
dat cog
dot hog
owu uwo
cat cat
zzz zzz
