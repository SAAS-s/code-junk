Recursion -- when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.

//infinite function calling
void f(){
	print(1)
	f();
}

int main()
{
	f();
}


when numerous fuction calls are  waiting due to recursion it calls for segmentation, stack overflow.

 condition to stop the infinite recursion ---base condition

 count =0
 f()
 {
 	if(count ==4)
 		return;
 	print(count)
 	count++
 	f()
 }

 main()
 {
 f();
 }

** stack space consist of yet to be completed functions that are waiting in stack for another function which is called at the time.
